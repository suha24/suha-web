        "description": "I am MS Office professional, that started co-using LO 8 years ago. I love MSO but not what MS has been doing to it. Many new versions were really bad news for me by constant (unnecessary) interface changes that added very little real functionallity that was not already in MSO 2000. In fact for a pro many things became a lot more time consuming. That is problem with commercial programs, in order to sell a new version to often mess up good programs with \"newness\" no one asked for or even appreciates. \n\nI found that the great thing about LO is that every new version is good news. and I notice little gifts in improvemenst in functionality and interface. LO has become a rock solid application, I use it on a daily basis and it has not crashed in years. Large documents load extremely fast and remain free of errors. \n\nAnyone who claims LO is limited is not an office professional. It has 99% of the functiions of MSO of which common users only use 5%. I really love working in LO. Though in MSO some higher funtions are more extensive, in LO they frequenty may work better. For instance, you can do more difficult layout with tables in MSO, but try creating formulas in them. \n\nThere is one area that MSO is clearly superior to LO and that is automation and application creation\n- First macro creation. in MSO macro-recording not only works better, it creates very readable Visual Basic code (VBA). This makes it easy for pro-users to build whole office programs using VBA. That is what makes MSO so popular in small and medium size businesses. Clever users create their own handy Office propgrams in Word and Excel. Macro recording in LO does not work that well and produces unreadable Java code, that only Java programmers will understand. \n\nSecond the lack of a good database program. MS Access is another diamond in which you can create office programs in VBA in a fraction of the time you would need in lower program languages. Again using macro's as a base in the beginning. I hoped that LO Base would be similar like Access but then as a GUI around a serious Database like Maria DN or Progress. There seem to be few people working on it and in 8 years it never developed into something that I found even slightly usuable. \n\nThird integration: In MSO programs like Word, Excel, Access also work perfectly together. for instance in Access you can link to data in an excell sheet of vice versa. You can output Access to Excel and Word. The best that came near this was Lotus Symphony, also an offshoot of Open Office. Which made it easy to link to data from other LO-programs, and even present them as tabs in one interface. Would it not be great to have a database in one tab, base an excel sheet on that with graphs in another, and use Word for things like mailmerge or reporting in again another tab. That would be something of a dream to me.",
